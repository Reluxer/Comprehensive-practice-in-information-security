# Implementation and attack of RSA algorithm based GMP library

## Desciption

This experiment need to do these things:  

- Install the GMP library
- Implementation of RSA algorithm
- Achive the attack of RSA algorithm

## Environment

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32bit

## Install

- In order to work with no panic,you need to install g++, gcc, m4 firstly. Like this:

    sudo apt-get install g++ gcc m4

- Then, get the [package of GMP]()
- Do like this:

	tar jxvf gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2
    cd gmp-6.0.0
	./configure
    make
	make check
	make install

- OK, that is enough.
-
